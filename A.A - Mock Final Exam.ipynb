    "The number of games played between each no-hitter in the modern era (1901-2015) of Major League Baseball is stored in the array nohitter_times. If you assume that no-hitters are described as a Poisson process, then the time between no-hitters is Exponentially distributed.  As you have seen, the Exponential distribution has a single parameter, which we will call tau, the average interval time. Compute the value of this parameter from the data. Then, use np.random.exponential() to \"repeat\" the history of Major League Baseball by drawing inter-no-hitter times from an exponential distribution with the \bÏ„ you found and plot the histogram as an approximation to the PDF. Assume you can refer to NumPy, pandas, matlotlib.pyplot, and seaborn as np, pd, plt, and sns, respectively.\n",
